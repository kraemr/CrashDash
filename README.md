# CrashDash
Crash Dashboard written in php, html and css



## DB Backend
- Mariadb
- DB:UnfallDB
- Table1:accident_data contains keys for def, to return text results join the keys with def
- Table2:accident_def, keys --> text

Table1:
- 


## Server
Make a PHP Api, where you can just request data in json.


## Frontend Map
- Html5 Canvas, Insert Points into the Canvas, on zoom reload canvas


## Ajax/Map Tutorials
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJesac0_Ftw
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSNa5b1mS5Y (Better / Way more convenient visualisation of the Data but idk if we are allowed to use tbh) 

## Heatmap
IF we are going to do a heatmap, then we should probably precompute it on the server instead of letting each client render it themselves.


## API 
- What data does the client need ? (number of accidents,number of accidents with passengers ...)
